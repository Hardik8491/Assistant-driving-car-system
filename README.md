According to the circuit schematic, the robot is powered by two 3.7-volt batteries connected in series, providing a total of 7.4 volts. The Arduino controls two infrared sensors for line following, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and a mini servo motor. The L298 Motor Driver facilitates the control of two DC gear motors for both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations.

## How to Use
