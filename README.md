)

According to the circuit schematic, the robot is powered by two 3.7-volt batteries connected in series, providing a total of 7.4 volts. The Arduino controls two infrared sensors for line following, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and a mini servo motor. The L298 Motor Driver facilitates the control of two DC gear motors for both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations.

## How to Use

1. **Assemble the Robot:**

   - Follow the provided instructions to assemble the 4-wheel robot car kit.
   - Connect the various components as per the circuit diagram.

2. **Upload the Code:**

   - Use the Arduino IDE to upload the provided Arduino code (`Assistant Driving Car System`) to your Arduino UNO.

3. **Power On:**

   - Turn on the power switch to activate the robot.

4. **Observe Robot Behavior:**
   - Place the robot on a track with a black line and observe its ability to follow the line.
   - Introduce obstacles, and the robot should navigate around them using the ultrasonic sensor.
